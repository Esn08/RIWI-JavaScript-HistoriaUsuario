# Interactive System Project

This project is a functional JavaScript implementation designed to interact with users through the browser. It requests personal information, validates the input data, and provides dynamic feedback based on the user's age.

## Description

The main goal of this project is to practice fundamental JavaScript concepts such as variable declaration, data types, user input/output, and conditional logic.

The program performs the following actions:
1. Prompts the user for their name and age.
2. Converts and formats the input data.
3. Validates if the age provided is a valid number.
4. Displays a personalized message using an alert based on whether the user is a minor or an adult.
5. Logs an error to the console if the input is invalid.

## Project Structure

* index.html: The entry point that loads the JavaScript logic.
* sistema_interactivo.js: Contains the functional logic, data validation, and user interaction scripts.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Follow the prompts on the screen to enter your information.

## Technical Skills Applied

* Variable declaration using `let` and `const`.
* Handling data types (String, Number).
* Using browser APIs: `prompt()`, `alert()`, and `console.error()`.
* Implementation of conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`).
* Data validation using `isNaN()` and `parseInt()`.
* Code documentation through explanatory comments.
