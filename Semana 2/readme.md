# User Story 2 (Data Management with Advanced JavaScript Structures)

This project focuses on the implementation and manipulation of advanced data structures in JavaScript, specifically Objects, Sets, and Maps. It demonstrates how to organize, store, and validate information efficiently through a practical exercise of product management.

## Description

The application performs data handling tasks including:
1. Product Creation: Capturing and validating product details (ID, name, price, and quantity) to store them in a JavaScript Object.
2. Uniqueness with Sets: Using the Set object to manage a list of numbers, ensuring unique values, and performing basic operations like adding, checking, and deleting elements.
3. Associative Storage with Maps: Converting object data into Map structures to handle key-value pairs more flexibly.
4. Iteration Techniques: Demonstrating different ways to traverse data using for...in, for...of, and forEach() methods.

## Project Structure

* index.html: The main HTML document that serves as the entry point and links the script.
* gestion_datos.js: The core logic file containing the implementation of objects, sets, maps, and their respective validations.

## Features and Tasks

* Task 1: Interactive product registration with data validation for names and numerical values (price/quantity).
* Task 2: Demonstration of Set functionality, including automatic duplicate removal and element manipulation.
* Task 3: Transformation of object entries into a Map structure.
* Task 4: Detailed iteration of all structures to display information clearly in the browser console.
* Task 5: Use of Object methods such as Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries().

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have the project files (index.html and gestion_datos.js) in the same directory.
2. Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.
3. Open the Browser Console (F12 or Right Click -> Inspect -> Console) to view the output and results.
4. Interact with the prompts on the screen to enter product data.

## Technical Skills Applied

* Modern JavaScript syntax using let and const.
* Data structures: Objects, Sets, and Maps.
* Control flow: do...while loops and conditional if/else statements.
* Iterators: for...in, for...of, and forEach().
* Data validation using isNaN() and type conversion.
* Dynamic ID generation using Math.random().
